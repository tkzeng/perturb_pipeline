#' Calculate barcode ranks
#'
#' Compute barcode rank statistics and identify the knee and inflection points on the total count curve.
#' 
#' @param m A numeric matrix-like object containing UMI counts, where columns represent barcoded droplets and rows represent genes.
#' Alternatively, a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} containing such a matrix.
#' @param lower A numeric scalar specifying the lower bound on the total UMI count, 
#' at or below which all barcodes are assumed to correspond to empty droplets and excluded from knee/inflection point identification.
#' @param exclude.from An integer scalar specifying the number of highest ranking barcodes to exclude from knee/inflection point identification.
#' @param fit.bounds,df Deprecated and ignored.
#' @param assay.type Integer or string specifying the assay containing the count matrix.
#' @param ... For the generic, further arguments to pass to individual methods.
#'
#' For the SummarizedExperiment method, further arguments to pass to the ANY method.
#' @param BPPARAM A \linkS4class{BiocParallelParam} object specifying how parallelization should be performed.
#' 
#' @details
#' Analyses of droplet-based scRNA-seq data often show a plot of the log-total count against the log-rank of each barcode
#' where the highest ranks have the largest totals.
#' This is equivalent to a transposed empirical cumulative density plot with log-transformed axes, 
#' which focuses on the barcodes with the largest counts.
#' To help create this plot, the \code{barcodeRanks} function will compute these ranks for all barcodes in \code{m}.
#' Barcodes with the same total count receive the same average rank to avoid problems with discrete runs of the same total.
#' 
#' The function will also identify the inflection and knee points on the curve for downstream use.
#' Both of these points correspond to a sharp transition between two components of the total count distribution, 
#' presumably reflecting the difference between empty droplets with little RNA and cell-containing droplets with much more RNA.
#' \itemize{
#' \item The inflection point is defined as the point on the log-rank/log-total curve where the first derivative is minimized.
#' If multiple inflection points are present, we choose the point that immediately follows the knee point.
#' \item To find the knee point, we draw a diagonal line that passes through the inflection point in the log-rank/log-total curve.
#' The knee point is defined as the location on the curve that is above and most distant from this line.
#' }
#' Only points with total counts above \code{lower} will be considered for knee/inflection point identification.
#' Similarly, the first \code{exclude.from} points will be ignored to avoid instability at the start of the curve.
#' 
#' @return
#' A \linkS4class{DataFrame} where each row corresponds to a column of \code{m}, and containing the following fields:
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{rank}:}{Numeric, the rank of each barcode (averaged across ties).}
#' \item{\code{total}:}{Numeric, the total counts for each barcode.}
#' }
#' 
#' The metadata contains \code{knee}, a numeric scalar containing the total count at the knee point;
#' and \code{inflection}, a numeric scalar containing the total count at the inflection point.
